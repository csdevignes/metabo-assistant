This conclusion is supported by the genes and compounds that were found to be altered. The genes such as CYP26A1, RDH5, ADH5, ADH1B, SDR16C5, UGT1A5, and DHRS4 are all known to be involved in the metabolism of retinol (Vitamin A) and its derivatives. These genes encode enzymes that catalyze various steps in the oxidation, reduction, and conjugation of retinol, retinal, and retinoic acid. The alterations in these genes would thus affect the levels and activities of these enzymes, leading to changes in the concentrations of the corresponding metabolites. The observed alterations in compounds such as Metarhodopsin, beta-Carotene, all-trans-13,14-Dihydroretinol, all-trans-5,6-Epoxyretinoic acid, 9-cis-Retinal, 4-Oxoretinol, 9-cis-Retinoic acid, 9-cis-Retinol, 11-cis-Retinal, and all-trans-4-Hydroxyretinoic acid, which are all intermediates or products of the Retinol metabolism pathway, further support this conclusion."}], "target": "Retinol metabolism"}
