This pathway is involved in the conversion of sugars, specifically pentoses and glucuronates. The alteration of genes such as UGP2, UGDH, and various UGT and AKR genes supports this finding. These genes are known to be involved in the synthesis and metabolism of UDP-glucuronate, a crucial compound in this pathway. Additionally, the altered compounds, including L-Lyxose, D-Xylonate, UDP-glucuronate, and D-Glucose 1-phosphate, are direct participants in the pentose and glucuronate interconversions pathway. Therefore, the changes in these genes and compounds strongly suggest that this pathway is implicated in the observed condition."}], "target": "Pentose and glucuronate interconversions"}
