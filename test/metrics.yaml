- metric: accuracy
  rubrics: |
    Score 1: The pathway found in output is not even a metabolic pathway.
    Score 2: The pathway found in output is a metabolic pathway.
    Score 3: The pathway found in output is clearly stated and almost identical to the target pathway (ex: synthesis instead of degradation of the same compound).
    Score 4: The pathway found in output is clearly stated and exactly the same as the target pathway (perfect match).

- metric: informativity
  rubrics: |
    Score 1: No or incomplete citation of genes and compounds, or no justification
    Score 2: Genes and compounds are cited but are not properly used to justify pathway choice, useless information
    Score 3: Information about genes and compounds are exact and used properly to justify pathway choice in output.

- metric: format
  rubrics: |
    Score 1: Output is longer than 200 words and does not include a metabolic pathway.
    Score 2: Output is longer than 200 words or does not include a metabolic pathway.
    Score 3: Output is shorter than 200 words and include one clearly named metabolic pathway.
