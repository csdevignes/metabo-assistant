This conclusion is supported by the alterations observed in several key genes and compounds associated with this pathway. AGXT, encoding the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase, is involved in the oxidative branch of this pathway, which is responsible for the production of NADPH. The alteration of AMT, encoding the ammonia transporter, suggests a potential role in regulating ammonia availability, which is a key component of the pathway. The increased levels of compounds such as Oxalate, Oxaloacetate, Propanoyl-CoA, Acetate, Ethylene glycol, and Glycine, all intermediates in this pathway, further support this conclusion. The alterations in cis-Aconitate, Mesaconate, Succinyl-CoA, and D-Ribulose 1-phosphate are also consistent with this pathway, as these compounds are involved in the metabolism of carbon and energy. The presence of Hydrogen peroxide, a byproduct of this pathway, also indicates its activation.

Mutations in this gene can lead to primary hyperoxaluria type 1, a disorder characterized by the overproduction of oxalate and the formation of calcium oxalate kidney stones.\n\nThe AMT gene, on the other hand, is involved in the glycine cleavage system, which is responsible for the breakdown of glycine to produce ammonia, CO2, and a methylene group (attached to tetrahydrofolate). This pathway is also connected to the metabolism of serine and one-carbon units.\n\nThe altered pathway could involve the accumulation of oxalate due to a mutation in the AGXT gene, leading to an imbalance in the metabolism of compounds such as glyoxylate, glycine, and oxaloacetate. This could also affect other pathways that involve these compounds, such as the citric acid cycle (involving citrate, cis-aconitate, and succinate), the glycolysis pathway (involving glycolate and 2-hydroxy-3-oxopropanoate), and the pentose phosphate pathway (involving D-ribulose 1-phosphate)."}}

NDUFA13 and NDUFA7 are subunits of NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I), which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone, releasing H+ ions into the intermembrane space.\n2. UQCRC1 is a subunit of cytochrome bc1 complex (Complex III), which transfers electrons from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, also releasing H+ ions.\n3. COX6C and COX6B1 are subunits of cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV), which transfers electrons from cytochrome c to oxygen, pumping protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space and creating a proton gradient.\n\nThe compounds H+, Succinate, NADH, and NAD+ are all involved in this process. Succinate is a substrate that enters the ETC at Complex II, while NADH is a substrate that enters at Complex I. The H+ ions are pumped across the membrane by Complexes I, III, and IV, creating the proton gradient that drives ATP synthase (Complex V) to produce ATP. NAD+ is the oxidized form of NADH, which is regenerated at the end of the ETC.\n\nIf there's an alteration in any of these genes, it could disrupt the functioning of the ETC, affecting the cell's ability to produce ATP and potentially leading to various diseases."}}
